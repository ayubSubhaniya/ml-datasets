4272,"After a very unfortunate and disappointing incident with Etihad on the 23rd of September, 2017, I contacted Etihad, via email to seek a resolution (ref. 586185). On the 28th of September, 2017 I received an email from an Etihad Representative, Batool who thanked me for writing in, advised that Etihad would be investigating the incident, and asked that I be patient during the investigation. After two weeks had passed with no update from Etihad, I sent another email following up in reference to the incident but received no reply. It has now been a week since the follow up (3 weeks since the incident) and still no reply from Etihad.I must say that the disappointment and lack of customer service from the UAE’s top airline has been a second-rate and unacceptable experience.The details of my experience with Etihad on the 23rd of September, 2017 are detailed below.My name is Daniel McGrew, Etihad Rewards Member Number 106838670960, and I am writing to inform you of the very disappointing customer service and check-in experience on the 23rd of September, 2017 at 7:00AM en route to a business trip in Dallas.Two months ago, I purchased airline tickets for Etihad flight 0161 leaving from Abu Dhabi, UAE at 9:10AM, 23/9/2017 en route to Dallas, Texas arrival time 4:15 PM (American Express Trip ID: 2544-1123) for a business trip.On 23/9/2017 at 7:00AM I arrived on location at the Abu Dhabi International Airport with my luggage (2 checked bags and 1 carry on). Upon arrival, I attempted to check in at the free standing kiosks located near the front entrance of Terminal 3. While attempting the check-in process, I observed that the kiosk advised that I needed to speak with a reservation agent. I then walked over to the check-in line where I observed that the line was very long and winding back and forth three times. While waiting in line I now observed that the time was 7:10AM. I observed a Reservation Agent (unknown name) walking up and down the boundary of the line calling at for passengers flying to Phuket and Rome. At approximately, 8:05AM I reached the counter to check-in. Upon approaching the Etihad Reservation Agent (unknown name) I greeted the Reservation Agent, turned over my passport, and advised the Reservation Agent of my destination. The Reservation Agent then asked me if I had completed the on line check-in in which I advised him that I had not. The Reservation Agent sucked his teeth and advised me that I should have completed the online check-in. I advised that Reservation Agent that I was unaware of the requirement and further had attempted to check-in using the free standing kiosks at the front of Terminal 3 by the front entrance upon my arrival but had received an error advising that I needed to speak with a Reservation Agent. The Reservation Agent then advised me that the reason that I received the error was because the system was now closed for departure. I asked the Reservation Agent how this could be as there is over an hour to departure. The Reservation Agent then advised me that I would need to rebook my flight. Shocked, I asked the Reservation Agent why I would need to rebook my flight as I had arrived to the airport two hours prior to departure. Further, there was over an hour until departure. The Reservation Agent then referred me to the Etihad Duty Manager, identified Junaid.While speaking with Junaid, I advised him of what the Reservation Agent had advised me. I further advised Junaid that I arrived at the airport two hours prior to departure and that there was still over an hour until departure (9:10AM). Junaid advised me that if I had in fact arrived two hours prior to departure I would have been accepted on the flight. Surprised by that statement, I advised Junaid to review the abundant CCTV footage within the airport and he would in fact see for himself that I was in the airport two hours prior to departure if he did not believe my statement. Junaid then advised me that a Reservation Agent was calling out all of the flights prior to departure attempting to locate any missing passengers. Additionally he advised that had I been in the line, as I had advised, I would have heard the Reservation Agent calling out my flight. The fact that the Etihad Duty Manager was arguing with me, the customer, on this matter appeared very unprofessional. I then advised Junaid that it was not my responsibility to prove this method to him. I further stated that he had ample resources to account for my location within the airport if he so wished to do so. Junaid then stated that it was not his responsibility either and that there was nothing that he could do for the matter. He then stated that I could speak with the Reservation Desk about rescheduling my flight. Extremely frustrated at the unprofessionalism of the flight arrangements and now the attitude of the Etihad staff that I had spoken with, I walked to the Etihad Reservation Desk to seek a solution. Upon arrival to the desk, I spoke with an Etihad Reservation Agent identified as Usama. I advised Usama that Etihad was refusing my reservation and that I had been advised to reschedule my flight accommodations. While speaking with Usama he advised that I would have to pay AED 2,235.00 to rebook my flight. I advised Usama that I would not pay to rebook my flight for Etihad’s refusal to place me on my flight in the first place. I advise Usama that I had arrived on time and further it was now 8:15AM with the plane that I was scheduled to take, Flight 0161 still on location. I, again, advised Usama that I had acted responsibly in arriving to Abu Dhabi Airport early as to avoid any issues such as this and that I would not pay to rebook my flight. Usama then took a bathroom break while I attempted to contact the delegation for advisement. I re-approached the Reservation Desk and observed that Usama still had not returned. I then spoke with a Reservation Agent identified as Edward (seated to Usama’s left, my right). Edward asked me if I would like to rebook my flight. I advised Edward that it was not right that I should have to miss my flight in the first place. Additionally it was not right that I now have to pay to rebook my flight and further advised him that it was now 8:20AM and that it seemed very unprofessional. Edward advised me that this was the only option available to me. I asked Edward if I could speak with his manager on the subject. Edward pointed in an away direction and advised, “You already spoke with the Duty Manager (Junaid), you will need to speak with him.” I advised Edward, “That would be fine, can you call him?” Edward then advised me that I would have to go and find him. Confused, I asked Edward, “So, you won’t call for a Duty Manager to come speak with me at the Reservation Desk?” Edward again advised that if I wanted to speak with the manager that I would need to go and find him. Again, this was a very unprofessional encounter. Edward, the Reservation Agent, was not going to locate anyone to assist me on the matter, it appeared that I was on my own to locate additional help. I left my bags at the Reservation Desk and began to search for the Duty Manager in the airport. Just beyond the Baggage Drop line for Etihad I found Junaid, the Duty Manager, speaking on the phone and talking with another Etihad staff member. I asked Junaid, “Can I speak with you please?” Junaid advised that I could. After shortly ending his phone call, he walked out from the staff area to speak with me. I advised Junaid of the conversation that I had with both Usama and Edward in which Junaid advised me that if I wanted to leave out on another flight I would have to pay to rebook it. I then asked Junaid to confirm my understanding stating, “To understand, I arrive here at Terminal 3 two hours prior to departure, wait in line for an hour, and then 1 hour 05 minutes prior to departure I cannot board the airplane? Further, you’re stating that what I have told you is in fact not true and I must pay to rebook simply because you say so?” Junaid again stated that if I had been on location as advised I would have heard the Reservation Agent calling out my flight. I advised Junaid that I didn’t appreciate him continuously accusing me of false statements. I again advised him that I had in fact done what was required and that it was now 8:20AM. Junaid refused stating that there was nothing that he could do.Confused, disappointed, and frustrated, I re-approached the Etihad Reservations Desk to rebook my flight and pay the AED 2,235.00 at 8:26AM. I was advised by Usama to contact the Etihad customer service department to report my comments.On the 24th of September I arrived at the airport to check-in to the rescheduled flight. Not only did I pass through security, customs, and airport procedures in 45 minutes, the flight that I was advised I hadn’t had time to board the day prior, did not start boarding until 8:36AM. Additionally, the new booking and change of flight itinerary given to me by Usama had no information in reference to boarding time as I had previously been held accountable for the previous day. Upon making my way through security, I was given an actual boarding pass, ETKT 6072133376478-4 that indicated a boarding time 0740 hrs. Again, Etihad staff did not start boarding until 8:36AM (took a time stamped photo as I passed through check-in). For the second day in a row, a customer in my case would have no idea on a proper time to board until after they had passed through security, leaving no way for the customer to pre-plan prior as to the proper time to arrive at the airport to allow ample time to pass through airport procedures. Today was a very disappointing experience with Etihad. Not only am I an Etihad Rewards Member and ADCB Etihad credit card holder, but I am now late to a business meeting in Dallas and late to my hotel booking. I had high expectations from Etihad but the lack of professionalism from your staff today was very disappointing. Additionally, the lack of organization, consistency, and communication from Etihad to Etihad customers is a second-rate experience and does not display that of a top tier airline. Further, the only email that I received from Etihad was that of an advisement for a flight reminder, Reservation ID: RIFITM on the 21st of September, 2017. Should Etihad require some special advanced arrival, due to specific destinations, they should coordinate this with their customers in a more professional fashion. I have no way of knowing how long your check-in lines will be. Regardless, I maintained a responsible arrival time of two hours prior to departure which should have been more than enough to facilitate the check-in process. Last, the entire incident from the time I greeted the first Reservation Agent at check-in until I left the airport on my way back to my residence took 44 minutes. This could have been time used much more efficiently. I would like a full refund in reference to the AED 2,235.00 that I was charged for the rebooking of my flight. Additionally, I would like to make a formal complaint in reference to the unprofessionalism of both Junaid, the Etihad Duty Manager, and Edward the Etihad Reservation Agent. I would like to commend Usama’s professionalism during the encounter and transaction. Last, I would like Etihad to make this large inconvenience of a day late to a very important international business event right. I spent my time, travel to and now from the airport, and I have missed my hotel booking in Dallas, Texas at the Sheraton Dallas. I forwarded the documents to Etihad Customer Service and have additional documentation available upon request.",Complaint

I had 2 checked in bags and 2 carry ons(one carry on had two sets, one to keep medicines,travel pillow and a blanket. It weighted 1.5kg. 2nd attached bag had 4kg weight) I also had a laptop bad as a carry on. I was stopped at the gate by boarding crew and refused boarding, unless otherwise I seperated the bags and checked on in because according to their Genius count it was two carryon item and 2rd laptop bag. Even though the carry on luggage was one piece with 2 attachments to separate stuff to keep them organized. They demanded me to pay 320 dollars for extra luggage or miss the flight. I was threaten to pay for it since I couldn't miss my flight as my other baggage was already checked in. I am very disappointed the way this matter has been handled by your check in crew and boarding crew. I had been mislead by the Checking person that allowed me to take the small two compartment bag as a carry on and then threaten and mistreated by your check in crew. I want someone to look into this matter and get back to me. I would like to thank you in advance for any inquiry that you may launch to investigate this matter.

9513,"FAO Etihad Management Team UAE, we are writing regarding the poor service Eithad Abu Dhabi has delivered to my mother. My mother who is 66 and partial deaf has currently spent over 10 hours in an airport in Abu Dhabi due to a delayed flight from the UK.Her flight was supposed to leave Heathrow airport at 20:00 GMT on 07/01/2018. This flight was delayed until 21:30 GMT meaning my mother arrived in Abu Dhabi sometime between 04:00 and 05:00 GMT+4. This resulted in her missing her transfer to Dar Es Salaam which was due to leave 04:20 GMT+4.On check in we were promised by your UK team that she would be given a hotel inspite knowing she had an Indian passport to stay in while Etihad sort out the connecting flights from Abu Dhabi to Dar Es Salaam and Dar Es Salaam to Mwanza as they agreed that Eithad were responsible for the missed flights.Neither of the above have been completed by the Abu Dhabi Etihad team and as a result my mother has been sat in the airport offered only a breakfast and dinner voucher which hardly covers the stress both she and her family(in the UK and Tanzania) has been put through. As a 66 year old women she was unable to find herself to get comfortable and therefore has had nowhere or no time to sleep which has put her in a discomforting position.Furthermore, all conversations so far have been through my mother which has involved in a high international call price but which is not as significant as the distress this has put my mother in.As if this was not enough of an inconvenience, Etihad has said that after causing the initial delay from London Heathrow the connecting flights were going to be missed as stated by the UK team. However, they told us we would be compensated for the troubles and as stated before, all flights after, including the Dar es Salaam to Mwanza flight, will be sorted by the Abu Dhabi Etihad team. After speaking to staff from Etihad in Abu Dhabi we are now being told it is our responsibility to sort the connecting flight from Dar es Salaam. Not only does this show a lack of communication but unprofessionalism due to the lack of ethical consideration for an OAP and her family. So to sum up, my mother has had nowhere to sleep, only been given 2 food vouchers and given no hotel to rest in due to a VISA issue. Also, Etihad has troubled me, my sister who has been making numerous phone calls to Etihad, our mum and our dad who was waiting for our mum in Mwanza. You must understand our feelings but more importantly the pain our mum has gone through and take action now on all of the above ________",Complaint

I am a Etihad guest silver member and used my points to reserve their seats next to each other 33A, 33B at the time of buying tickets but for some freaking weird reason, you guys have changed their seats during check in at the airport and gave them separate seats way back in the plane tail close to the rest rooms. When I have talked to your staff at the airport about this, they said they can’t help it because flight is full. My parents did not sit together during the whole flight.

On my return journey from Canberra to Edinburgh I had to wait 7 hours at the airport due to a cancellation of flight and then delay of reroute via Melbourne flight with your partner providers Virgin. I was then told I couldn't make my connecting flights and would need to return to the airport the next day. I was never sent emails or given information regarding this and I had to personally phone Etihad who seemed to have difficulty communicating with Virgin as to how best to resolve my travel situation. I fortunately phoned Etihad again on the night I was delayed and the girl on phone only at this point confirmed my flight. Had I not done this I may have been delayed even further. When rerouted via Melbourne I contacted the Etihad office and spoke to a girl there about my situation. I asked about possibility of upgrade due to the delay and distress. She was unable to do this but said she would try to get me three seats for Melbourne to Abu Dhabi flight. I did have one free seat but was asked to move during flight to accommodate another passenger whose inflight entertainment was not working. This was my first experience of travelling long haul and using Etihad. To summarise - I had an overnight delay on the way to Canberra and an overnight delay on the way back . I had to make several phone calls, received no explanation or apology email or information on original cancellation and was told by Ethad staff the problem lay with Virgin. ALL my flights were booked via Etihad and therefor any difficulties Etihad have with communication with Virgin are for Etihad to resolve not myself. I would hope Etihad will see to suitably compensating for the distress,delays and lack of communication appropriately . I will be sharing Etihad's response on social media. I attach my travel reference and look forward to your response. I have not attached all the flight numbers ,dates and changes as I'm sure you can see these for yourself from my booking reference. If you feel Virgin are responsible for travel issues on my return journey I will expect you to resolve this on my behalf as I did not book with Virgin but via Etihad for all my flights.

8790,"ETIHAD Airlines - You have proved once again how callous, lazy and inefficient you are; I deplore you and all you stand for. My partner is as we speak about to get home from Australia after nearly 40 hours. Her second flight from Abu Dhabi to Paris was so late into Paris that she missed her flight to Manchester and had hell on to get a rearranged flight. Your ""partner"" (I believe) Air France were about as useful as a cat-flap in an Elephant House - they did nothing to help her. But, let's talk about you, a so-called professional organisation. You knew you flight was late, you knew who was on it and you knew that some of those on it had onward flights; you knew all that the minute the plane left the ground in AD. You had 7 hours to put in motion processes to help those who would be stranded at the other end in Paris. You did NOTHING. My partner did tell your on-board staff of her situation; they let her be one of the first off the plane and left her to her own devices. Of course she missed her flight. You arranged NOTHING illustrating how lazy and mean you are. You show all the signs of a company struggling financially - it took an hour and a half to check in in Sydney; you only had 2 people, then 3 manning the desks for a huge plane. You are clearly managing your costs and ratios to your advantage and caring not a jot for the people who pay your salaries. Worryingly, I am still in Australia and travel home the same route early February. I don't have the finance to change airlines being retired otherwise I would. You are lazy and incompetent and I despise you for causing so much stress just because you can't be bothered. Please direct me to the proper complaints procedure where I can set about procuring the compensation that we deserve. You don't deserve any praise whatsoever. Linton Woodman",Complaint

15029,"Hi we have had a rather unsatisfactory experience with Etihad. We were delayed by 12 hours this was due to a safety issue which understandably we were disembarked from the original aircraft. This was not a problem as obviously it is beyond Etihads control. What was the problem however is the events that have now followed. We were offered a 4.5 hr bus trip down to Heathrow to be put on a flight there which when we have two small children, one of which needs immediate access to a toilet this is not possible. We were then told if we refused to do this then we needed to ring up the call centre to arrange another flight, we did this and got told that they needed to sort it out at Manchester airport with the business class lounge manager. When we asked her about it she said she was unable to help and we need to ring the call centre back again! We called the call centre back again and they then said they would call us back. After over an hour of waiting for a call back my husband yet again rang the call centre to be told that as far as they were concerned we were on a bus to Heathrow and we needed to speak to the lounge manager again. The poor manager in the lounge who was lovely and was as helpful as she was able to be said this was not the case and we had to do it all through the call centre. We again rang the call centre and along with the lounge manager also speaking to them to explain she is unable to rebook us we were finally booked on a flight later that evening. We were assured (after checking 3 times) that our luggage was on the flight so we finally happily arrived after a very cramped flight in the knowledge we could enjoy our couple of days rest at the hotel in Abu Dhabi before our final leg to Sydney tomorrow. This however was not the case as none of our cases were on the flight as promised more than once. When we went to the lost baggage we filed a missing baggage form. We were then told we would be kept updated, again this was not the case after numerous phone calls and the phone constantly ringing out my husband finally managed to get through to the lost baggage and was told they think they have found our bags but only 3 of them!! It was only this morning that we actually had confirmation that our bags have been located.This has cost us a lot of time and money to have to buy clothes to wear, toiletries etc and all the phone calls we had to make which meant that we were unable to enjoy our relaxation of enjoying the hotel and pool due to not having anything to wear and time taken up trying to locate the bags, not to mention the stress of not knowing if we would see all our stuff again.The communication has been poor to say the least and there has not been any apology or compensation offered at all for the time and money we have lost. Kind RegardsElizabeth Jones",Complaint

Re case number 612988We have now had confirmation from the Indian Embassy that my parents should have been allowed to fly as the problem with the name could have been sorted in India when they arrived. This means Etihad did make a huge mistake in not allowing them to fly and then charged them 400 pounds to make a totally unnecessary change to this Saturday. I have received a completely impersonal email from your ‘Online Community Officer’ telling me I need to understand that these things take time. I need you to understand that you have ruined my parents holiday, taken 400 pounds that you should not have taken and then have given me a totally rubbish example of customer service by not being able to deal with this now and telling me it will take 21 days!! This is rubbish service. They are getting on an Etihad plane again this Saturday. I think they should have had a refund of the extra 400 pounds they did not have to pay - in fact, I think you should be flying them business class for all the pain and suffering you have caused, not withstanding now you are saying we have to wait 21 days.

31961,"This is what I've received from Eithad staff, and when I've lodged the complaint all I did received so many excuses and an apology few weeks later from Lucy Aitken, customer relations officer. I totally agree there service is not same as before. Dear Sir/ Madam I am writing to you today to make a complaint regarding the way I was treated on my recent trip to London from Dhaka via Abu Dhabi. At first I would like to state that I am a silver member and frequently fly with Etihad since 2006 but you may notice on your system I've became a silver member since 2016. Even more so because of this I was appalled at the treatment I received from Etihad Staff at Abu Dhabi. From Dhaka to Abu Dhabi the flight was delayed by 45 minutes approximately but I have no complain regarding this.During our connection in Abu Dhabi, the passengers for London were called just after we got from from the aircraft from Dhaka and we were rushed to the boarding gate and without explanation at the counter my seat number was edited by pen from 50 A whichever had been per-booked a long time ago before to 54 A. Despite many requests to the two Etihad females staff (description as European white late 30s) at the last boarding counter I did not get a valid reason why my seats was changed, rather they were rude, arrogant and miserable even though there was an Indian male staff he came towards me from no where and telling me to put my voice down. I've asked the both females to give me their names and in return they both covered their name plates and refused to give to me and walked away. I didn't had enough time to speak to the duty officer as t was the last passenger to board. This is not acceptable behaviour, because I always recommend my friends and family members to fly with Etihad so as the least I would expect is an explanation for this kind of behaviour I've received. I would wait to hear your comments.Yours sincerely Mohammed Rahman --------------------------",Complaint

15216,"Hi,This is related to Shweta Panchal booking ref. NANKZS booking done on 10/6/17.After 15 days or so we recieved an e mail that there is a problem.So I called from 9183970491 and they said all fine and also confirmed a seat from XNA to Chicago as 16 A.Now when i went to check inn on 2/18/18 i do not see the flight from XNA to Chicago. and so called from my cell 9183970491 and asked what is going on. i was told that someone will call after 24 hrs. which did not happen and then after 24 hrs i called again and was told someone will call after 2 hours. which also did not happen so i called and said that i will not give up till things are final. Finally got a ticket XNA to DFW DFW to AUH and AUH to Mumbai.I did complain for the short time at DFW only one hour.So made a call again as i was not happy for this ticked and was advised to pay $ 32.43 for a special seat in front row so she will save time. Also requested that as she is with heavy dose of pain killers and leg pains no strength. she will need a handicap chair service. and all set to go.This american airlines flight from XNA to DFW was delaid and so i made a call and was told that it is american airlines fault and they will have to manage it. ETIHAD is not at fault.So we contacted American airlines at XNA and they said that they will manage it at DFW as the ticket needs to be released buy Etihad. But now you just go to DFW and things will be sorted there at DFW.So my wife flew to DFW and at the customer service there were @300 persons with same problem and she did not know what to do. I again called american airlines and found out her new booking number that is BQUPHN and they then told the gate number and the terminal and some how she managed to catch the flight to London. and from London to Mumbai Via British airways.After landing she did not get her 2 checked in bags. so filed a claim BOMBA 25524. and was told that she will get her bags in 72 hrs.I made a call as her medical papers were in the bag and the Dr is not ready to proceed further as he needs the records and test reports.Can you imagine me sending 1 to 2 attachments at a time to the doctor via 3 e mails address as it does not permit more than 50 mails at a shot.@ 200 pages. almost the whole night.The Dr did not do the necessary operation and said that after he receives the hard copy papers he would proceed further.Now do shopping for cloths, makeup and personal items as she had to attn a marriage function. So as per the plan she moved to the marriage function on 2/23/18 to 2/26/18.She receives a message that she has to come to Mumbai to sign the papers to collect the bag.So drop the marriage event in between and she went back to Mumbai just to sign the papers to take the bag and at last she got it.Now the real catch. her bag was opened as we had plastic warped both the bags and surprised to see that only the Gold jewelry is missing for the red bag. Most important is it was her wedding gift 30 years back i had given her and is 12 tola real gold (24k) I do have the pictures for the bag opened and the wedding jewelry pictures.Now totally disepointed for the lost of her most valuable jeweler and then go back to hometown by road at an extra cost is a pain. having no mood of enjoying at all. HER THIS TRIP WAS A DISASTER.Still Dr have not started the operation and will let us know on Tuesday.All this just as I have booked a ticket from ETIHAD. and so now I want ETIHAD to help me get all my loss and value to the time and unnecessary pressure. Total a wrong suggestion for giving us a ticket for such a short time at DFW.My e mail is panchal61@yahoo.com Cell 9183970491",Complaint

26719,"Pity that Etihad managed to just about spoil Christmas for 1 Aussie family. Late leaving Sydney because of weather.Told repeatedly by ground crew in Sydney and flight staff in the air that we were fine and would still make our flight. The line given was ""Ground crew in Abu Dhabi know that we are running late. They are holding the flights open for you. The pilot has also made up time so all will be fine"" ""You will make your connections"" Not truE!!!!!!!!!! Rerouted through Munich. We flew some airline, from Munich that I have never heard of in my 30 years of international travel, with the man in the seat in front of me insisting on putting his seat back, and laying across my knees for the 2hour and 5minute flight, taking up the 2cm of room between my knees and the seat in front.Christmas dinner consisted of a half ""sandwich"" of ""meat"" or ""cheese"". Could not tell what the meat was, but that didn't matter, as there was no way one could get through to the meat as the bread was so dry that it disintegrated on one's lips and had to immediately be ejected into the closest napkin. Flight staff, when asked what meat it was just replied ""meat""Told our bags would arrive with us.Not true!!!!!!! Arrived so late we missed Christmas Day. 3 bags still missing. Had to see airport staff, fill in forms. Car hire place closed some 10 mins before we got there. Would have made it if not held up by missing luggag. The luggage that we were promised would arrive with us.£35 to get to our accommodation by Taxi, extra because it was Christmas Da!!!!!!!!I have no medication for my boys. We have no change of socks or undies for any of us. Then we have now received an email from Etihad:I click onto the link to a YouTube video titled ""The most wonderful flight of the year!"" Showing guests in Manchester airport being treated before boarding their plans to spend Christmas the way they had planned. Not respectful at all!!!!! Like the salt in a still very open wound. When this video was mentioned to a supervisor in Abu DhabI, the man put his arm around my shoulder and said""Oh don't worry about it, I don't celebrate Christmas for two weeks, I'm orthodox."" Really, who cares...... I wonder if he will get to spend it the way he wants???? This is not what we expected from the best airline in the world... Lies, lies and more lies. This is our third trip on Etihad in the past 18months and we paid more for the peace of mind. We are travelling with two boys who have disabilities, one of these beautiful children has multiple disabilities and medical issues and relies on his medication everyday. I spilt his medication across four bags, as it is quite a bit, and there are too many questions at each security point about the medications so it is easier to pack them. Three of the four bags are missing. We havel travelled many times before and this has never been an issue, because we choose who we fly with.I have only a short supply of this medication with us. I really hope that we get our bags today. We have now had a message about 2 of the bags, they are expected to arrive tonight???No word on the third???I now wish that we didn't have to travel home with them. How is this story inline with any customer service. Let alone customer service at Christmas time.",Complaint

I am currently sitting in the JFK airport hoping that I can get a rescheduled flight to Bangalore as I have to be there before Monday for work. I arrived at my gate (A7) to catch my flight, and was told that my paperwork needed to be verified before boarding when I reached the gate attendant. I walked over to the desk and presented my passport and e-visa (on my phone) and the agent said that unfortunately the evisa must be printed and asked me to step to the side so that someone could print it for me.The supervisor came to speak to me, last name Lavant? and stated again that my e-visa needed to be printed and that there was nothing he could do to help. He suggested I try some stores in the airport to see if they had printers. He stated that I had time and they would wait.I walked all over the airport visiting almost every store, the Delta Sky Lounge and finally Air India who said “Why are they having you do this? there is a printer up front and a printer in the Etihad lounge.” I walked to the Etihad lounge and the young lady there was more than willing to help but also perplexed at why I was asked to run around to stores, she called the gate to let them know I was there and she was printing my visa for me and then called the front desk to have the e-visa printed (the lounge printer failed to work). Someone from the gate came to pick me up and walked me back, I thought I was going to make it but was told upon arriving back at the gate that the flight was closed and that I needed to pick up my bag at another location and call Etihad to get another flight.I went to the baggage location and my bag was nowhere to be found. I called Etihad and spoke with an agent who stated I would be charged a fee unless someone could update the system indicating that I should not be charged one. I made my way back out to the ticket counter (bagless) and asked for help, the agent at the desk made a phone call and said that they would waive my fee but that I would have to call the Etihad ticket system back to get my flight booked, she said it would be easier to just call my travel agency instead.I have never experienced customer service like this before in my entire life, with the exception of the lounge attendant and the young lady who printed my visa, every person I interacted with from Etihad acted like they could care less or just simply did not know what to do. I can say for sure that if at all possible I will never fly Etihad again. Hopefully I can get my flight rescheduled and I really hope I can find my bag. Shame on you Etihad!

23097,"Just got back to London after an absolute nightmare of a journey .Originally scheduled to arrive back in the Uk 12:00 midday on Friday leaving Shanghai Thursday evening (25th) in time for a gig @The Crypt on Friday night .That flight was cancelled due to weather conditions but mostly due to the fact that Shanghai airport had only one functioning de-icer machine to clear the ice off the planes.my journey was delayed by 24 hours ,enduring very little sleep and a 7 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi .It wasn't the airlines fault but their ground staff in Shanghai were appalling,there was very little information and we were couped up in the plane on the first day for over 5 hours before the decision was made to cancel the flight .Of course it couldn't fly as the plane needed to be clear of ice,but we were not kept in the picture at all .More disorganisation and chaos followed in the next 3-4 hours whilst they trapsed us back through customs and baggage and onto buses setting off for a destination unknown .The hotel they put us up in was ok but by the time I got to the restaurant clutching my voucher for breakfast there were only crumbs left and cold coffee .I managed to get through to the London office who fixed me an alternative flight back which they sent as an e ticket only to withdraw the offer 30 mins later ,and told me if I turned up to the airport independently that my ticket would not be valid .They also promised me an upgrade and lounge vouchers both in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi.. Arriving back at Shanghai airport wired and hungry I then discovered that the promises of an upgrade to business class and lounge passes had also been withdrawn .At this point I lost it and after a few minutes of intense discussion the desk staff issued me a 1st class lounge pass but not until I used the words ""I'm starving I haven't eaten in 12 hours and your company has broken its word You should be issuing all these passengers with 1st class vouchers "" I think they feared a mass revolt as I was hastily given the lounge pass .@Etihad Airlines have some wonderful flight attendants and their service and food on the planes is second to none.Their ground staff in Shanghai and customer services in the UK is absolutely appalling .Beware folks . To make matters worse missed both a gig with my Quartet at The Crypt on Friday night and a Rehearsal with NYJO on Saturday morning .So glad to be back and massive apologies to all those who attended the gig at The Crypt on Friday night and to the NYJO cohort #Travelnightmares #EtihadAirlines #ShanghaiAirport #sogladtobebackhome",Complaint

When the wagon was pulled past me I saw a whole bunch of packages of milk on a tray.

18523,"I flew with Ethiad on Dec 30th to New Delhi with a code share partner Jet airways.All I can say is that I will NEVER fly Etihad again.Firstly the people checking in customers at DFW- ridiculous and rude. From that interaction (my first) I sensed that it was going to be a long flight. There was an elderly couple travelling in the front row in the same flight. The flight attendant was ""Rude"". She kept rolling her eyes and one could sense sarcasm in here tone.Flight from Abu Dhabi was mostly full of people from the destination area. Not everyone speaks or is fluent in the language (English). This one flight attendant made jokes about this one passenger. UNACCEPTABLE.The code share flight which was Jet airways was delayed by about 8 hours due to ""fog"" although another flight to the same destination left between 10.00 and 11.00.Return flight what can I say- Abu Dhabi to DFW- The customs and immigration is done in Abu Dhabi. But once you are aboard they make you feel like they don't care. The meal service was poor. Mind you most of the times you are asked and you give your choices at the time of booking an international flight.When passengers asked about food, a flight attendant responded ""Well we will be landing in Dallas shortly and you can eat whatever you want there"". Other flights will accomodate you with maybe a small snack.14+ hours flying non stop is not easy. Most of us including me travelled with Etihad for the first time due to a family emegency.Now that I have seen the attitude and the way they treat their customers.Personally I have flown Emirates, Qatar and some airlines from Europe. Never had or witnessed this kind of experience with any other airline.So maybe Etihad needs to get its act together.Remember ""You do not fly people for free. You do charge them a hefty ticket price"". So provide the service that you have been paid for.",Complaint

We are seeking urgent assistance to change our flight details and I am not sure the agent will be able to assist in time. We flew into Geneva and we're still in the area. We desperately need to make a change for family reasons. We'd like to fly out of Geneva to Abu Dhabi this Sunday (instead of heading onto London). The reason for cutting short our trip is that our eldest son is having anxiety issues and is desperate to get home. He's fine to fly (in fact the airline is his favourite place) but the continuing our holiday is not sustainable, and that's the advice we've been given from Australia too. So recognising that the agent may not have time or capacity to make changes (including a route change) I am hoping you may be able to assist. I realise you have no obligation in this regard, but your colleague assisted me only a few weeks ago when I was shifted from my flight by the agent. Our reference is SABQYR.

24145,"My experience today with Etihad as a first passenger. Decided to fly Etihad instead of Emirates as a frequent flyer and experience the other emirates national airline. First part: as resident in Dubai, I was entitled to a bus transportation from Etihad Mall to AUH airport at 23:00. When arrived at the Mall, the security guard on site informed that the centre has now been closed and has moved to Mazaya Centre. The communication was not communicated via email, on Google Maps it appears as Etihad Mall as well as in your website. With time constraint, it was practically impossible to go from Etihad Mall to Mazaya Centre in a time span of 10 minutes when I was waiting for a taxi outside the mall for more than 10 minutes. It was obvious that I would miss the bus. Hence I took a taxi directly to AUH airport which cost me 215 AED. When boarding the plane, the bus took us and dropped of to the wrong aircraft. With no aircrew on board, all doors open (risk of children falling). After 5 minutes where passengers had placed their luggage in the overhead cabins, the drivers comes and asks us to shift to another aircraft. I have a video as a proof.

13485,"hi Etihad, I just had the worst experience with trying to check in in Sydney, all that as a first-class passenger which makes it particularly upsetting. First, as soon as I approached the gate, the person behind the counter left and didn't come back for almost 10 minutes. All the economy and business passengers were being checked in in a prompt manner but nobody was delegated to the check-in the (queuing) first class passengers. We asked the manager and the response was that the guy probably went to the toilet and will be back soon, no apologies for inconvenience or delegating another person to do the job. I would expect, paying for the first class ticket, to be assisted in a first-class manner.Secondly, there was nobody to assist with putting the heavy luggage on the scale. The person at the counter didn't offer any help either.Thirdly, I was informed that I arrived too early to check in my luggage. When I asked for possible solutions so that I don't have to carry 3 heavy suitcases around the airport for the remaining 3 hours before I could check in, I was informed that I can use the lockers. Again, no assistance offered, no explanation where the lockers actually are, no effort whatsoever to solve my problem or advise anything. I am really upset with the Etihad first-class experience so far (still waiting at the airport with all my luggage until the check-in for my flight is available - although with any other airline it's perfectly fine to check in 4 hours before departure). I will certainly never use the Etihad ""first class"" service again. I have been treated by your staff much better as economy or business passenger.",Complaint

My friend bought ticket in Bangkok to visit Ireland. Economy class return, after immigration extended her stay to three months from 2 weeks. I changed return date to later for additional 460 euro last october. Money taken by Etihad from my card and ticket sent via email. 2.5 months later we go dublin airport and check in only to be then told there was no booking the original travel agent had cancelled it 10 hours after I booked it with Etihad on october 2016. It was january 11th 2017 when eventually told of the problem. So I have a friend whose visa is near finishef in airport ? Bought 1 way economy back for more money 1026 euro. But not Etihads problem.... 2.5 months no email, phone call to tell me there is a problem....they just kept mum and sold her seat for more moneyEtihads take..1st return ticket in BKK 900 euro.

11858,"Hello, I am writing this complaint with regard to being offboarded from my flight recently. On January 9th, 2018, I was flying from Mumbai to Washington, D.C. with a layover in Abu Dhabi. However, I was offboarded from the flight at Abu Dhabi on the grounds of being late to the gate and therefore was forced to purchase another single ticket from Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Washington, D.C. This caused me grave financial difficulty as I had to pay $1,200 for the new ticket, and was utterly disappointed by the Etihad staff and their treatment of the situation. To elaborate further - my flight from Mumbai landed in Abu Dhabi at Terminal 1. I was unaware that I had to change terminals for my flight to D.C. as I am not familiar with that airport. I thought my flight to D.C. was boarding from T1 Gate 3. I approached Gate 3, T1 at approximately 9:00am and asked the woman at the counter (an Etihad staff member) if that was the correct gate for flight EY 131 to Washington, D.C. She responded that it was the correct gate. I proceeded to wait just outside the gate near the duty free shops. I went back to her at 9:55am and asked when the flight to Washington, D.C. would be boarding as it was approaching the time of departure, and she said to come back in 15-20 minutes. When I returned at 10:15am and stood in line for my boarding pass to be scanned, they then told me that this was the wrong gate and that I had to go to Terminal 3 Gate 60. I was completely unaware of this information but proceeded to run to T3 right away after asking for directions from the same lady at the counter, who profusely apologized for giving me the wrong information and told me that she would call the flight to Washington and ask them to wait while I ran to the gate. However, when I reached the correct gate, it was too late as the doors had already closed. I asked some Etihad staff for help about next steps and was treated extremely poorly. First, two of your staff members raised their voices at me about reaching the gate late even after I told them why I was late, and then they sent me to two different Etihad counters without clear directions. I was thus circling the airport trying to find someone who could help me, and every time I approached a new counter the staff seemed extremely unfriendly and unwilling to contact the correct desk. I finally approached the third transfer desk and spoke to two staff members, and was appalled at the way the situation was being handled. They told me there was nothing they could do and that I had to figure out my next flight's booking myself. I told them that I had no wifi and could not contact my parents, who were in Mumbai at the time, and asked if I could use someone's phone for a free incoming call from my father to tell him what had happened and try booking another flight. However, they kept me waiting for the phone for 30 minutes and only offered a solution after I pleaded with them several times. I am not a minor, but was travelling alone nonetheless, without any family. Having missed my flight and being in a foreign country without knowing the language, I expected more professionalism, help, and knowledge of the situation from Etihad's staff members than I received. First of all, the woman at T1 Gate 3 should not have told me the wrong information two times. As I was confused and could not read the Arabic electronic boards, she should have corrected me the minute I told her my flight number and destination. I would have been one hour early to the gate if she had taken a second to listen to what I was saying instead of blindly advising me to wait there. Second, she never called the counter while I ran to the correct gate - I believe that if she had called ahead and told them of the situation, they might have been able to accommodate me on the flight since it hadn't taken off yet. Third, the staff at all three counters were absolutely unprofessional in the way they spoke to customers. I waited at the third counter for more than an hour and had the misfortune of observing your staff speak to two other families who had been offboarded for various different reasons, and was completely shocked at how often they raised their voices and were rude to everyone in an unfortunate circumstance. Instead of trying to help or even connecting us with the correct people who could provide better assistance, they told every passenger there (including me) that they couldn't do anything and we had to figure it out ourselves. I travel to the US two times a year and will continue to do so for the length of my studies abroad. However, after this terrible experience with Etihad, I am not likely to every fly with the airline again, let alone recommend it to family and friends, all of whom fly equally frequently via UAE. To say I was appalled and mistreated is an understatement. After paying so much for an airplane ticket, one places infinite trust in the airline's capability to treat you as a respected customer. However, I definitely did not experience anything of the sort with Etihad. I demand to be compensated for being told the wrong information twice by your own staff, which cost me to miss my flight and buy a new ticket worth $1,200. This situation would not have arisen if she had done her job and advised me, a lost passenger, where the correct gate was. Thus, I expect Etihad to compensate me for the cost of the new ticket. I also urge you to take a look at the security camera footage at Terminal 1 Gate 3 to verify all the information in this message, as you will see me approaching the staff member at the counter two times and then running to Terminal 1. If you can verify this information, it stands to reason that I should be compensated for the new ticket, as I would have definitely made the flight if I was told the correct information by the staff member immediately. I also suspect that the flight was overbooked, as may other passengers were also offboarded from other Etihad flights for various reasons and I was told by one of your staff members at the transfer desk that Etihad always overbooks its flights to the US. This is possibly why the woman at the counter didn't call ahead to inform the flight to Washington of my delay even though she said she would, and also why your staff was so incredibly rude in handling the situation. I expect nothing short of a prompt and accommodating response to this situation for compensation for how I was treated. If this situation is not addressed in the manner it deserves, I plan to resort to publishing this on social media platforms in order to gain public awareness for your airline staff's lack of knowledge, professionalism and helpfulness, and the consequential financial costs to passengers like me. I appreciate your time and am willing to work with you to sort this out as soon and quickly as possible. Thank you, Anushka Agarwal",Complaint

Etihad staff were not responsive and didn’t offer me flight via Amsterdam. I was rerouted to my final destination not under comparable transport conditions. My flight conditions from Abu Dhabi to Riga were downgraded and operated by low quality Airbaltic airlines (with no free meals, low service quality, baggage restrictions, not properly working lavatories, no entertainment program etc.). Please note that knowing Airbaltic flights quality, I had intentionally chosen KLM and have paid approx. 500 EUR extra for my original flights.

I had a terrible, tasteless spinat roll while small flight from KHI to AbuDhabi, which I did not eat.While my second flight from Abu Dhabi to MUC on EY3, I was feeling ill and vomit-like. First I vomitted in washroom, but still was not feeling better, some air hostesses saw me but did not even bother to come to me. I had a very bad breath afterwards and deny to eat anything while I was starting to get a fever. Due to high fever and bad breath, I could not control my vomit and did it on seat. I ran to air-hostess for some help but she did not come to me or not even gave me any tablet, and said to me that sorry, I am not responsible for cleaning. I was completely helpless with high fever,other passengers were looking me sympathetically. I cleaned myself everything, went to washroom and cleaned my clothes. Nobody came to me to give me even some drops of water or medicine. In short, I was getting worse throughout the flight and nobody even come to me, even one air hostess shouted on me, that I am disturbing flight while running towards washroom. At landing, when everyone left plane, and I was collecting my hand-carry, one air-hostess came to me and asked that Ma'am are you fine? I just wanted to slap her but I really controlled my self.IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY TRAVEL THROUGH ETIHAD. I WILL NEVER OPT IT IN FUTURE.

As soon as I saw the details, I called to address the issue. Had I received the confirmation email with flight details I would have made the changes within the 24 hour cancellation period. I only received generic verification emails and never accepted or declined the terms as I was in transit. By the time I access the emails, the pages had expired. The only reason I called Etihad on 30 Dec was to get confirmation numbers so that I could bid for upgrade. It was only then that I saw the itinerary was incorrect. I have requested that the penalty fee be waived given I never received a confirmation so that I could address. If it is not waived, I would like some kind of consideration (upgrade, etc) given the handling of this manner. Please get back to me as soon as possible. My confirmation number is ZZBBCT.

Your airline offered no alternatives, your representative at Dublin airport charged me 178 for better seating even though I already paid for it already when I booked, I was then told I could be upgraded to business class at a price of nearly 3k from Dublin to Bkk. It was the first time I have flown with Etihad and after this will be the last, I made it very clear to your staff at airport I needed to rest on flight as I was very sick with chest infection , cough, fever, but your representative put me seated beside a family with two young children who was seated in the seats I should have got. The manager on plane stated this is not the first time this has happened and many complaints have been lodged but obviously nothing has been done. For such a high profile airline , you should get your priorities right and not treat customers like this. I am out of pocket due to your error and there has been no contact with me whatsoever. I normally fly with Emirates or Turkish and I have never once experienced anything like this with these airlines.I will not be letting this go and will be talking to a legal team as soon as I am back in Dublin seeking full compensation. On my return journey home in two weeks I will pay a different airline to take me home rather than fly with yourselves but as stated I will be taking legal action and all expenses will be billed to your airline.

11656,"Hello,I have booked air tickets with Etihad airlines two times and have been disappointed by the service I received both the times.I have booked Air tickets several times with many other airline companies including a small airline companmy companies and have never had any inconvenience.In 2016 I booked a one way journey on 28th March 2016 from Bangalore to London Heathrow for 3 people (Me, My dad and mom) {Airline reservation No: XGUEBU} which is supposed to start from Bangalore at 0435 and reach Heathrow at 1305.But they gave excuses and made us to take a delayed and longer route which made us reach 10 hours late and I have to take a day off with no pay the next day. Physical inconvenience caused to me and my elderly parents were on top of it. I wrote an email to your feedback team and they gave 30000 complimentary miles altogether.Although I was not very happy about it, I made a consideration as it could be a once in a while thing and perhaps you did the best you can.Now after almost 2 years, I booked a flight ticket for my mother in law to board the flight on 27th Jan at 0955 (Booking Reference EVUNVZ)She was asked to take a longer route with more delay with no proper explation. She has to wait till 1740 to board a flight to Abu Dhabi and has to wait there for 6 hours to get the connecting flight.My mother in law travelled alone and it took double the time for her to reach here compared to the booking time. She had suffered a lot in the journey and is still feeling sick due to your way of operation. I made special bookings for 28th Jan for my wedding anniversary which went in vain. For an international airline company, it is definitely not an acceptable way of operations and management.Flight delays due to weather conditions are acceptable, but without any of those happening why am i getting victimised for consecutive two times?Can you explain why your flights are causing these problems to me for consecutive two times? How I can trust this wont happen for a third time?How are you going to compensate for the financial loss, physical inconvenience and wasted time I and my family members faced?PS: Your feedback team is not responding which is why I am asking here.

Please refer to our Conditions of Carriage, Article 8.3.4.We are unable to comply with your request for compensation.

This will require us to take some electrical Test equipment, which is in a wheeled Pelicase, due to the equipments fragility. The case weighs approx 30 - 35 Kgs, so would this be able to be classed as hold luggage (excess baggage), how would we process this package through security and would i need to follow any processes or provide you with information prior to the trip ? This equipment would be brought back to the UK on completion. Many thanks in advance. Please could i be contacted on steve.tamblyn@vectoraerospace.com, many thanks Steve Tamblyn",Enquiry

32910,"We were delayed in Abu Dhabi for 7-8 hours due to this issue and arrived 12 hours past our original ETA but I have to say the handling of this was absolutely appalling. The missus and I are frequent users of Etihad and until our last experience have had a good experience with them but the way our delay was handled was nothing short of shocking. We were en route from London to Manila with a 1.5 hour stopover at Abu Dhabi. We were delayed by 1 hour in London but made our way to Abu Dhabi in a reasonable time. When we arrived in Abu Dhabi airspace we ended up circling for 1 hour but had little to no communication why we were not landing. We asked the cabin crew regarding our connecting flight several times on what our next steps were are we were unsure if we would get our next flight. We continued to ask only to be told 90% of the passengers have connections and we would be told when we land. After we finally landed being on the plane for almost 9 hours, we were advised to go to the Transfer desk. On arriving at the Transfer Desk there was little information but when we advised our final destination, they asked us to go to the gate as the plane was still there. My wife and I rushed to the gate (My wife was pregnant so running not ideal) and on arriving at the gate we were told that we had been moved off the plane. I questioned why this was the case even though we made it while the connecting flight was there. No explanation was given except we need to go back to the Transfer desk. We were left out of the loop with no information and very stressed as no one could give us any useful information apart from go to the Transfer Desk where there were 150-200 very angry people all in the same position. None of the Etihad staff were informed of next steps and nothing was being attempted to try and make our lives clearer. After waiting in line for 1.5 hour we were finally advised we had been booked for the 10am flight (originally 3am flight to MNL). It was only after further complaining we were given food vouchers although no place of rest or accommodation was offered. While trying to use the food voucher in Mcdonald's we were advise whether we want chicken or beef. Considering the delay and problems, we would have expected to have a choice of food from the menu but only to be given an option of chicken or beef. Eventually we survived through to getting our connecting flight only to be shouted at by Etihad staff as we tried to board our flight to MNL. We had our carry-on luggage with us which contained medicine and valuables and as we tried to get on the bus to take us to our plane, an Etihad member of staff told us we must check in our hand carry. On explaining we need to keep it due to medication, we were shouted at and threatened with being unboarded from the flight. What made this all the more frustrating was many other passengers had multiple carry on luggage while we had a standard single hand carry as per plane policy. This is simply unacceptable no matter the circumstance or issue. These flights are charged at a premium especially at this time of year and premium service is also accepted.We finally boarded the flight to MNL and while delayed a little further we made our way to MNL. When we arrived we went through passport control and awaited our luggage. After waiting approximately an hour, we received 1 or our 3 checked in full sized suitcases. We asked the airport staff to check and they were unable to trace where they were. After almost 30 hours of travelling we had to fill out forms and explain Etihads mishandling of our baggage. Unfortunately we had gifts and presents for our family which we were unable to give on Christmas day and were without clothes, toiletries and other medication we had checked in.We tried calling the Etihad number given to track our luggage but without success and tried calling numerous times but no update. We contacted via twitter and email and again no response was received which continued for 3 days. Eventually we did get our luggage but Etihad’s delivery called at 3 am in the morning advising they were looking for our property to deliver the items. Again the customer service was not good enough, no consideration for the passenger or to deliver at a convenient time, just a case of passing on the problem as soon as possible. We were grateful to finally receive our luggage albeit 3 days late. Also the sheer stress caused both my wife and I to get ill during the last leg of our flight.This is just not the level of service we expect from what is regarded as a 5 star airline. We were moved around like cattle, treated with disrespect and contempt for an issue that was not our problem. We appreciate ‘acts of God’ are unavoidable but the whole situation was shockingly handled. My wife had a similar issue due to a sandstorm in Dubai but my wife was given accommodation by Emirates to rest while waiting for problem to subside. While not ideal it made the issue less painful. In this delay we had to fight for what should have been given and handled by Etihad and its staff. We will not be recommending Etihad or its services to others on the back of this situation and my Wife who has a strong influence in the travel industry and travels frequently has never encountered such a badly handled situation or service. We expect so much better and were so badly let down. The sad truth is this incident is not isolated to us and no attempt has been made by Etihad to even apologise for this. A little crisis management would have gone a long way but instead no management at all seems to be the solution for Etihad.Not good enough!",Complaint

22726,"It's been three weeks now that we're waiting for a refund of almost € 9.000 ,-for cancelled flight tickets. Mr Mike Luett bought and cancelled them. The refund should be transfered to my bank account, Selina Weller. He forwarded all the necessary details of my account before christmas and was told that the payment would be authorized immediately.The department which is responsible for refunds was, according to my information, not able to transfer the money to a bank account which is not related to the person who originally booked the flights. Instead of consulting Mr Luett, they simply changed the name of the payment recipient into Mr Mike Luett. As the bank account is mine (and only mine), the transfer was refused because the bank account didn't match with the recipient. Thursday last week, there has been another phone contact with you. You promised to authorize the payment one more time, this time the recipient should be indicated as ""Selina Weller c.o. Mike Luett"". This was one week ago - since this day, there has been no payment receipt, nor has anyone of your corporation tried to contact us. A transfer within Germany (we were told that we receive the refund from a bank located in Leipzig), even between different banking institutions, normally takes up to 2 days. So I'm really, really keen to know where our payment went.I'm so disappointed, there is not only a lack of the first class service that you're claiming for your carrier, this is not even a professional behaviour. We're feeling as if somebody lend our money and refuses to return it, though you have no right to keep it! This flight from FRA to SYD, via stopover in AUH, should have been our first long-haul business class flight with your carrier - I think that was the first and also the last time that I considered Etihad Airways.
